Roman numerals are a numeric system that originated in ancient Rome and was used throughout the Roman Empire. They are still used today in certain contexts, such as on clocks and in some legal documents. However, Roman numerals can be difficult to work with because they are not a positional system like decimal `(base 10)` or binary `(base 2)`. Instead, they are a subtractive system that uses a combination of symbols to represent numbers.

In this article, we will show you how to convert a Roman numeral to an integer using JavaScript. We will assume that the input string is a valid Roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`, as specified in the problem statement. We will also explain the algorithm used to convert the Roman numeral to an integer.

## Algorithm

To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, we can iterate over the string from left to right and keep track of the current and previous values. If the current value is greater than the previous value, we subtract the previous value from the total. Otherwise, we add the previous value to the total. At the end of the iteration, we add the last value to the total.

Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:

1. Initialize total to `0`
2. Initialize previous to `0`
3. For each character `c` in the string:
	- If the value of `c` is greater than previous, subtract 2 * previous from total
	- Add the value of `c` to total
	- Set previous to the value of `c`
4. Return `total` + `previous`


In JavaScript, we can implement this algorithm as follows:

```js title="javascript" showLineNumbers
function romanToInt(s) {
	const romanValues = new Map([
    	["I", 1],
    	["V", 5],
    	["X", 10],
    	["L", 50],
    	["C", 100],
    	["D", 500],
    	["M", 1000],
  	]);

  	let total = 0;
  	let previous = 0;

  	for (const c of s) {
    	const current = romanValues.get(c);

    	if (current > previous) {
	      	total -= 2 * previous;
	    }

    	total += current;
    	previous = current;
	}

  	return total;
}
```

This implementation uses a Map to store the values of each Roman numeral symbol. It then iterates over the string and applies the algorithm described above to convert the Roman numeral to an integer.

### Conclusion

Converting a Roman numeral to an integer can be a challenging problem due to the subtractive nature of the Roman numeral system. However, by following the algorithm described in this article, we can convert a Roman numeral to an integer in JavaScript with ease. Understanding the constraints of the input, such as the valid range of values and the allowable characters, can help us optimize our solution and ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.
