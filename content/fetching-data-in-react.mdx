In modern web development, efficiently fetching data is a crucial aspect of building robust and interactive applications. With React JS developers have several modern techniques at their disposal for fetching data. In this blog article, we will explore the most popular methods and best practices for fetching data in React JS. Whether you are a seasoned React developer or just starting your journey, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to handle data fetching in a modern and efficient way.

Here are a few popular approaches for fetching data. Two commonly used methods are using the **Fetch API** or utilizing third-party libraries like **Axios**.

## 1. Using the Fetch API (built-in browser feature):
The Fetch API provides a native way to make HTTP requests in modern browsers. Here's an example of how you can fetch data using the Fetch API in a React component:

```js title="jsx" showLineNumbers {9}
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  	const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  	useEffect(() => {
    	const fetchData = async () => {
      		try {
        		const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        		const jsonData = await response.json();
        		setData(jsonData);
      		} catch (error) {
        		console.error('Error fetching data: ', error);
      		}
    	};

    	fetchData();
  	}, []);

  	return (
    	<div>
      		{data ? (
        		<ul>
          			{data.map((item) => (
            			<li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
          			))}
        		</ul>
      		) : (
        		<p>Loading data...</p>
      		)}
    	</div>
  	);
}

```

In the example above, the `fetchData` function is called inside the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the API endpoint `https://api.example.com/data`. Once the data is fetched, it is stored in the component's state using `setData`. The component then renders the fetched data or a loading message based on the availability of the data.

## 2. Using Axios (third-party library):

Axios is a popular HTTP client library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests. To use Axios in your React project, follow these steps:

First, install Axios as a dependency by running the following command in your project directory:

```sh title="Terminal"
npm install axios
```

Then, you can fetch data using Axios in your React component:

```js title="jsx" showLineNumbers {10}
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default function MyComponent() {
  	const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  	useEffect(() => {
    	const fetchData = async () => {
      		try {
        		const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
        		setData(response.data);
      		} catch (error) {
        		console.error('Error fetching data: ', error);
      		}
    	};

    	fetchData();
  	}, []);

  	return (
    	<div>
      		{data ? (
        		<ul>
          			{data.map((item) => (
            			<li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
          			))}
        		</ul>
      		) : (
        		<p>Loading data...</p>
      		)}
    	</div>
  	);
}

```

In this example, Axios is imported and used to make a GET request to `https://api.example.com/data`. The response data is then stored in the component's state using `setData`. Finally, the fetched data is rendered or a loading message is displayed based on the data availability.

Both of these approaches offer efficient ways to fetch data in ReactJS. The choice between them largely depends on your project requirements and personal preference.

## 3. Using React Query (third-party library):

First, you’ll need to install React Query using `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh title="Terminal"
npm install react-query
```

Then, you can use the useQuery hook to fetch data from an API. In this example, we’ll fetch a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API:

```js title="jsx" showLineNumbers {5}
import { useQuery } from 'react-query'

export default function MyComponent() {

  	const { isLoading, error, data } = useQuery('users', () =>
    	fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').
			then((res) => res.json()
    	)
  	);

  	if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  	if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  	return (
    	<div>
      		<h1>Users</h1>
      		<ul>
        		{data.map((user) => (
          			<li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        		))}
      		</ul>
    	</div>
  	);
}

```

Noticed this piece of code?

```js showLineNumbers
const { isLoading, error, data } = useQuery('users', () =>
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').
		then((res) => res.json()
    )
);
```

The code is using object destructuring to extract these properties from the object returned by the `useQuery` hook and store them in variables with the same names (`isLoading`, `error`, and `data`).

The `useQuery` hook returns an object that contains three properties: `isLoading`, `error`, and `data`.

- `isLoading`: A boolean that is true while the query is loading data from the API.
- `error`: An object that contains any error that occurred while fetching the data. If there was no error, this will be null.
- `data`: The data that was fetched from the API. If there was an error, this will be undefined.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, fetching data in React JS has become more streamlined and efficient with modern techniques and libraries. By understanding the available options and implementing best practices, developers can ensure seamless integration of data fetching in their React applications. Whether it's utilizing the Fetch API, leveraging Axios, optimizing performance, or integrating real-time updates, this blog post serves as a comprehensive guide to help developers master data fetching in React JS.
