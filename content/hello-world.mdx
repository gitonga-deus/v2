Welcome to my blog! I started this blog as a way to share my knowledge and experiences as a **frontend** and **javascript developer**. Over the past 2 years, I've worked on a variety of projects that have challenged me to constantly learn and improve my skills. 

Through this blog, I hope to provide you with valuable insights, tips, and resources that will help you stay up-to-date with the latest developments in frontend development and javascript. Whether you are just starting out or you are an experienced developer, there is always something new to learn and explore.

In the meantime please excuse the mess and constant changes. I am still playing around with some features.

Meanwhile...

```js title="console" showLineNumbers
console.log("Hello World!");
